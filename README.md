# Faculty Project Matching System - Team 3

A web application that facilitates seamless matching between students and professors for third year and final year academic projects. The system supports project listing, applications, scheduling meetings, resume uploads, and has seperate role-based dashboards.

## Features

* Browse and apply for faculty-posted projects
* Upload resume individually for each role/application and describe statement of interest
* Faculty view of applicants with student profiles
* Calendar-based meeting slot booking
* Dashboards for faculty and students

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Django and Python
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, FullCalendar.js library
* **Database:** SQLite (to make it portable)

This simple tech stack allowed us to learn while implementing the features ourselves with minimal help from AI :)
